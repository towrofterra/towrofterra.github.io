Once upon a time, in a little town, in a little tree, lived a little family of robins. There was mummy robin, daddy robin, and of course, <span style="color:red">Henry Robin</span>.

They lived in a place you might know as a small village in England, but they called it <span style="color:green">Greenwood Forest</span>.

Henry was only <span style="font-size:.8em;color:yellow">very small</span>, but he was <b><span style="font-size:2em;color:red">very loud</span></b>, and he loved to sing!

<span style="color:blue">He warbled in the water,</span>

<span style="color:white">Sung in the snow,</span>

<span style="color:green">And even hummed in the hedge!</span>

On quite a <span style="color:yellow">lovely sunny Wednesday</span>, Henry was singing his favourite song in his favourite spot - right on top of Mr. Farmer's <span style="color:yellow">big yellow tractor</span>. All of a sudden, his neighbour, Mr. Squirrel came by.

"Hello Mr. Squirrel", said Henry, "How are you doing today?" he asked.

"Well Henry, I'm glad you asked", smiled Mr. Squirrel. "I've been listening to you sing, and I think you'd be perfect for a _<span style="color:red">very special thing</span>_".

This made Henry very excited! _<span style="font-size:1.5em;color:red">Whatisit!Whatisit!Whatisit!"</span>_ he asked, not even pausing to take a breath!

Mr. Squirrel smiled warmly. "Well Henry, there's a singing competiton coming up very soon. Everyone in <span style="color:green">Greenwood Forest</span> will be there, and I think <span style="color:red"><b>you</b></span> should join in! You need to write your own song, and make sure to have a <b>message</b> that everyone can learn from"

Henry was very excited! He had heard of this competition, and decided that he was going to give it his best try!

"<span style="color:yellow">Do you have any tips for me</span>, before I leave to start writing my song, Mr. Squirrel?" Henry asked, politely. [[LG5]](https://towrofterra.github.io/LearningGoalEvidence/LG5.jpg "Students generate and pursue lines of inquiry and search, collect, and select sources appropriate to their writing projects.")

"Yes, Henry, I think it's very important that <span style="font-size:1.25em;color:red">you end on a long high note</span>, so that everyone knows when to start clapping!"

Henry gave a loud chirp to say thank you, and flew off to tell his best friend, Bertie, the news, and ask for her advice too! [[LG5]](https://towrofterra.github.io/LearningGoalEvidence/LG5.jpg "Students generate and pursue lines of inquiry and search, collect, and select sources appropriate to their writing projects.")

Henry found Bertie by the pond. "<span style="color:red">Hello Bertie!</span>", he chirped loudly. "I'm entering the big competition with my very own song, would you like to join too?"


Bertie also loved singing, but didn't want to enter the competition, because she was <span style="font-size:0.75em;color:yellow">quite shy</span>. "Well Henry, I think I'd be <span style="color:yellow">too frightened</span> to sing at the big competition, but I would you like to show <em>you</em> what I've been working on."

Bertie sang a _very_ pretty song about <span style="color:yellow">being modest</span>, and Henry enjoyed it a lot! "Maybe you could sing the last bit a little louder", he suggested, and Bertie liked the idea so much she tried it at once! [[LG10]](https://towrofterra.github.io/LearningGoalEvidence/LG10.jpg "Students provide revision-based response to their peers.") While Bertie was singing her song again, Henry listened very hard, and thought about what Bertie was singing about. [[LG9]](https://towrofterra.github.io/LearningGoalEvidence/LG9.jpg "Students practice critical reading strategies.")

Henry liked that Bertie's song had a <span style="color:red">moral</span>, and decided that his song would have a <span style="color:red">moral</span> too! He also remembered that most of the songs people sung at the competition last year had a <span style="color:red">moral</span> too, which made him even more sure! [[LG2]](https://towrofterra.github.io/LearningGoalEvidence/LG2.jpg "Students negotiate their own writing goals and audience expectations regarding conventions of genre, medium, and situation.")[[LG3]](https://towrofterra.github.io/LearningGoalEvidence/LG3.jpg "Students formulate and articulate a stance through and in their writing.")

Henry said thank you to Bertie for her help, and flew off to his favourite thinking spot to try and write his song. He started thinking about all the pretty melodies he could sing, and came up with his first draft!

After singing it as loudly as he could, Henry had <span style="color:red;font-size:1.25em">A Big Think</span>. He remembered Mr. Squirrel's advice, and made sure he ended his song on a <span style="font-size:1.25em;color:red">high note</span>. He also remembered Bertie's suggestion that he should sing <span style="font-size:.75em;color:yellow">quietly</span>, and wrote his song down again. This time it was even better! [[LG4]](https://towrofterra.github.io/LearningGoalEvidence/LG4.jpg "Students revise their writing using responses from others, including peers, consultants, and teachers.")[[LG11]](https://towrofterra.github.io/LearningGoalEvidence/LG11.jpg "Students reflect on their writing processes and self-assess as writers.")

Then, Henry practiced, <span style="font-size:1.1em">and</span> <span style="font-size:1.2em">practiced</span>, <span style="font-size:1.3em">and</span> <span style="font-size:1.4em">practiced</span>, <span style="font-size:1.5em">until he was <span style="color:yellow;font-size:1.5em">so tired</span></span>, <span style="font-size:1.25em">he</span> <span style="font-size:1em">couldn't</span> <span style="font-size:0.75em">practice</span> <span style="font-size:.6em">anymore, and fell </span><span style="font-size:.5em">fast asleep...</span>

...

...

...

<b><span style="font-size:2em;color:red">Cock-A-Doodle-Doo!</span></b>

Henry woke up! "Oh no!" he shouted, "It's almost time for the competition!"

He brushed his teeth and put on his best jacket, and flew as <span style="color:red">fast as he could</span> all the way to <span style="color:green">The Big Old Oak</span>.

All of his friends were there to cheer him on. Rupert Rabbit, Christopher Chaffinch, and of course, <span style="color:red">Bertie</span>!

Mr. Squirrel came up to Henry, and told him it was time for him to go on stage. Henry was scared, but he remembered to be brave, and went up in front of everyone.

Henry sang _beautifully_. Henry pretended he was just practicing, and he wasn't nervous at all! He realized that all the singing he did wasn't just teaching him how to sing - it also helped him understand the <span style="color:red">moral</span> he was singing about! [[LG1]](https://towrofterra.github.io/LearningGoalEvidence/LG1.jpg "Students write both to learn and to communicate what they learn.")

Henry ended his song <span style="font-size:1.25em;color:red">on a long high note</span>, and, just like Mr. Squirrel had said, the crowd knew just when to start clapping! Henry gave a <span style="color:red">big smile</span>, and left the stage.

Later on, it was finally time to announce the winner of the competition! Henry crossed his wings and closed his eyes, and when his name was called, he let out a tweet so happy that everyone around him couldn't help but smile.

That night, Henry told his mummy and daddy _all about_ his big day, and they were very proud. "I got up on stage, and sang in front of everyone!" Henry exclaimed, proudly!

"Wow Henry! How did you do that all by yourself?", asked mummy Robin.

"Well", said Henry, "I actually had help from my friends, and our neighbour Mr. Squirrel. I couldn't have done it without them! They taught me so much, in different ways." [[LG6]](https://towrofterra.github.io/LearningGoalEvidence/LG6.jpg "Students effectively use and appropriately cite sources in their writing.") [[LG7]](https://towrofterra.github.io/LearningGoalEvidence/LG7.jpg "Students explore and represent their experiences, perspectives, and ideas in conversation with others.") [[LG8]](https://towrofterra.github.io/LearningGoalEvidence/LG8.jpg "Students use multiple forms of evidence to support their claims, ideas, and arguments.")

After dinner, Henry went back to his room, and thought about all he'd learned that day.

He sat.

He thought.

Then he sang; and he sang his *best song ever* [[L11]](https://towrofterra.github.io/LearningGoalEvidence/LG11.jpg "Students reflect on their writing processes and self-assess as writers.")

    If I could restart this paper, I would probably choose a different topic, as, upon examination, S-L hasn't affected my education as much as it has affected my teaching. This distinction made it slightly harder to work with the class, and made me less able to take lessons from my peers' papers. However, I cannot think of a theorist in my field that <i>has</i> influenced my education explicitly. Reading the draft above mine (Quinton Hubbell's), I feel I should have taken more from my own studies in music, as I have had a very similar experience to him, which might have made for some compelling and more passionate writing.

Reading Quinton's draf, I was extremely impressed by how fluidly and compellingly the paper was written. I feel that my paper was more formally written, which is no bad thing, but it certainly made it harder for me to achieve the same 'flow'.

Overall, I'm happy with the work I produced; I spent most of my life receiving extremely substandard grades on any writing assignment (something I'm sure has something to do with the fact that I was forced to handwrite, an extremely painful activity for me), and have only recently begun to enjoy, and, in the process, improve, at writing. I hope that I continue to improve both in the scope of this class, and in my lexical endeavours elsewhere.

    I think that the reason for students mentioning the literature review in thank you correspondence is largely due to how applicable and relevant the task is to STEAM students. On a surface level, many students will attempt some form of research during their university careers, and this assignment gives them a background in an essential step of any research. This not only helps them complete the work, but might also be helpful in getting accepted into a lab.

On a deeper level, the ability to synthesize information is an essential skill in a great many careers; this assignment forces the writer to synthesize information from a wide array of different papers, practicing this skill.

With regard to my writing process, I did a huge amount more research than I am used to doing. Learning how to search different research archives is a skill I am glad I had the opportunity to practice. I also printed all papers and highlighted them; reading them with an eye for pattern recognition. This is something I have done before, but never to the extent that I did for this project. I also took more handwritten notes.

I think that the most interesting thing I learned whilst doing the paper was how much work is needed in the field of education research. I was shocked by the disorganization of so much research, as well as how few replication studies had been carried out. 

The best piece of peer feedback I received was the general tweaks suggested in Mike's peer review of my paper. He very clearly had done a close read, and I found his feedback very helpful!

    For project 3, I worked on the 3D printing article on simple english Wikipedia. I redid almost the entire article. There was no relevant discussion on the talk pages, and nobody has reacted to any changes I have made. I asked Ian for some technical assistance, but I did not receive any editorial feedback on my article. I wrote a peer review for Victoria, but there was not a huge amount to review at that point, so it was very basic. My big takeaway was that the simple english community is a lot less active than the english Wikipedia community, as I did not interact with anyone else.

I enjoyed writing my article. My writing process was very simple, as I was able to use the structure and content from the main 3D printing article. I rewrote the body of text, and added images to scaffold certain sections. I'm proud of my contribution to free information, as I think that 3D printing is something that may very well be a democratizing force, and as such, I think it is beneficial to have useful, simple, information available for free.

The most surprising thing about writing for Wikipedia was how technically complex it was. I'm very used to navigating computer systems, and it was a challenge to know how to achieve certain tasks. The next time I write such a document, I would probably try and consider the simple english format to ensure that my documentation is readable.
