# <u><b>The Story of Henry the Robin</b></u>

Once upon a time, in a little town, in a little tree, lived a little family of robins. There was mummy robin, daddy robin, and of course, <span style="color:red">Henry Robin</span>.

They lived in a place you might know as a small village in England, but they called it <span style="color:green">Greenwood Forest</span>.

Henry was only <span style="font-size:.8em;color:yellow">very small</span>, but he was <b><span style="font-size:2em;color:red">very loud</span></b>, and he loved to sing!

<span style="color:blue">He warbled in the water,</span>

<span style="color:white">Sung in the snow,</span>

<span style="color:green">And even hummed in the hedge!</span>

On quite a <span style="color:yellow">lovely sunny Wednesday</span>, Henry was singing his favourite song in his favourite spot - right on top of Mr. Farmer's <span style="color:yellow">big yellow tractor</span>. All of a sudden, his neighbour, Mr. Squirrel came by.

"Hello Mr. Squirrel", said Henry, "How are you doing today?" he asked.

"Well Henry, I'm glad you asked", smiled Mr. Squirrel. "I've been listening to you sing, and I think you'd be perfect for a _<span style="color:red">very special thing</span>_".

This made Henry very excited! _<span style="font-size:1.5em;color:red">Whatisit!Whatisit!Whatisit!"</span>_ he asked, not even pausing to take a breath!

Mr. Squirrel smiled warmly. "Well Henry, there's a singing competiton coming up very soon. Everyone in <span style="color:green">Greenwood Forest</span> will be there, and I think <span style="color:red"><b>you</b></span> should join in! You need to write your own song, and make sure to have a <b>message</b> that everyone can learn from"

Henry was very excited! He had heard of this competition, and decided that he was going to give it his best try!

"<span style="color:yellow">Do you have any tips for me</span>, before I leave to start writing my song, Mr Squirrel?" Henry asked, politely. [[LG5]](https://towrofterra.github.io/LearningGoalEvidence/LG5.jpg)

"Yes, Henry, I think it's very important that <span style="font-size:1.2em;color:red">you end on a long high note</span>, so that everyone knows when to start clapping!"

Henry gave a loud chirp to say thank you, and flew off to tell his best friend, Bertie, the news, and ask for her advice too! [[LG5]](https://towrofterra.github.io/LearningGoalEvidence/LG5.jpg)

Henry found Bertie by the pond. "<span style="color:red">Hello Bertie!</span>", he chirped loudly. "I'm entering the big competition with my very own song, would you like to join too?"


Bertie also loved singing, but didn't want to enter the competition, because she was <span style="font-size:0.75em;color:yellow">quite shy</span>. "Well Henry, I think I'd be <span style="color:yellow">too frightened</span> to sing at the big competition, but I would you like to show <em>you</em> what I've been working on."

Bertie sang a _very_ pretty song about <span style="color:yellow">being modest</span>, and Henry enjoyed it a lot! "Maybe you could sing the last bit a little louder", he suggested, and Bertie liked the idea so much she wrote it down to try at once! [[LG10]](https://towrofterra.github.io/LearningGoalEvidence/LG10.jpg) While Bertie was singing her song again, Henry listened very hard, and thought about what Bertie was singing about. <div class="tooltip">[[LG9]](https://towrofterra.github.io/LearningGoalEvidence/LG9.jpg)
